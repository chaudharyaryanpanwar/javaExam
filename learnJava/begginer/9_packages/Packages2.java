// To create a Package  , use the package keyword
// and then specify its name. In this example, 
// we're creating a new package called "mypack"
package mypack;
class Packages2{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("This is my package!");
  }
}
// Here's how you can fix the error:

// Create a directory named mypack.
// Move the file Packages2.java into the mypack directory.
// Ensure that the mypack directory is in the same directory where you compile and run your Java files, or adjust your classpath accordingly.
// Once you've organized your files and directories correctly, you can compile and run the Packages2.java file
