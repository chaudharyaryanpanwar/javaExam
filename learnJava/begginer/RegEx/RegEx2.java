// FLAGS
// Flags in the compile() method change how the search is 
// performed. Here are a few of them:
// Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE - The case of letters will be 
// ignored when performing a search.
// Pattern.LITERAL - Special characters in the pattern will not 
// have any special meaning and will be treated as ordinary 
// characters when performing a search.
// Pattern.UNICODE_CASE - Use it together with the 
// CASE_INSENSITIVE flag to also ignore the case of letters 
// outside of the English alphabet
